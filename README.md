# fractal-generator
This simple program will generate a fractal image when it's run. It is very primitive, but it works and gives very nice pictures. It replicates the common algorithm intended to create the colored Mandelbrot set, but it allows for further modifications making it generalizable.

## Available features

It features the following:
- The ability to choose any complex function to be used for generation
- The ability to choose any point as a center for the image (thus scrolling through the complex plane)
- The ability to change zoom (thus exploring 'in-depth')
- A progress bar to show the current progress of the calculations
- Parallelization to speed up the processing

## Improvements needed

This program is currently very crude and weak. It can probably get much better improvement. Particularily in the following areas:
- Correct handling of non-square images
- Automatic 'chunck_size' setting for best performance
- A better-looking color palette

as well as other neglected areas
